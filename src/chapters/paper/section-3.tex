\section{Methodology}

The purpose of this research is to create a hardware-in-the-loop-simulation
(HILS) system. The HILS system is intended for testing autonomous vehicle
hardware and software before using them in an operational environment. To
achieve that goal, this research process is carried out as follows

\begin{enumerate}
	\item learn the CARLA Simulator,
	\item analyze system requirements,
	\item study the implementation in the current conditions,
	\item exploration of tools and communication methods to be used,
	\item library design,
	\item implementation of the library,
	\item testing the library,
	\item integrate libraries into GRS and custom programs agent,
	\item system testing, and
	\item analysis of system test results.
\end{enumerate}
