\section{Limitations and Future Work}

This research is limited to only creating the communication mechanism to do a
simulation for autonomous vehicle development. Further research is needed to
create the whole simulation system, such as research to model the real world to
the simulation world and research to create test scenarios needed for autonomous
vehicle testing.

This research could also be improved by further testing and fixes. Especially to
fix lidar implementation so it can use lidar sensor with acceptable performance.
Further testing with multi-camera sensor would also improve this research. Other
than that, testing and adjusting the library created in this research using
other types of vehicle (not only tram) would also be beneficial.
