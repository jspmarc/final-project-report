\section{Related Work - Hardware-in-the-loop-simulation (HILS)}

In a related research a HILS system for autonomous vehicle is achieved
\cite{brogle_CarlaHILS}. The simulator used is also CARLA and the communication
is done using ROS. The difference with the current research is the hardware
used. In that research, NVIDIA Jetson TX1 is used, while this research uses
NVIDIA Pegasus and a substitute computer called RKB.

That research concludes that a HILS system using CARLA and ROS can be done. In
the research, a single ROS node is used and it listens to many topics which
relates to the sensor. With that configuration, it is found that the response
time in the simulation is even faster than real world \cite{brogle_CarlaHILS}.
