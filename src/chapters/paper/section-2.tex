\section{Methodology}

The purpose of this research is to create Hardware In The Loop Simulation (HILS)
and to test identical hardware and software scheme before running them in an
operational environment. The research process carried out is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item learn the CARLA Simulator,
	\item analyze system requirements,
	\item study the implementation in the current conditions,
	\item exploration of tools and communication method to be used,
	\item library design,
	\item implementation of the library,
	\item testing the library,
	\item integrate lirbaries into GRS and custom programs agent,
	\item system testing, and
	\item analysis of system test results.
\end{enumerate}
